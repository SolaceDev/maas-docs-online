How to Configure Authentication
================================

You can manage messaging services authentication with PubSub+ Cloud. 

PubSub+ Cloud allows microservices to connect to your messaging service with Basic Authentication, and Client-Certificate Authentication.

- **Note**: Client-Certificate Authentication is only supported on dedicated infrastructures (not Free service types).

Configure Basic Authentication:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Note: Basic Authentication is the default setting for a PubSub+ Cloud service.

1. Go to your messaging services page by selecting Services from the top navigation bar.
2. Select your messaging service to navigate to messaging service details.
3. On the service details page, navigate to the Manage tab.

- Note: If you disable Basic Authentication then an error will be showing stating 'You have authentication disabled. Your messaging service is accessible by everyone.' This is not recommended.

Configure Client Certification:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Go to your messaging services page by selecting Services from the top navigation bar.
2. Select your messaging service to navigate to messaging service details.

2. Select your messaging service to navigate to messaging service details.
3. On the service details page, navigate to the Manage tab.
