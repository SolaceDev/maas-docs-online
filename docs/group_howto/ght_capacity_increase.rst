How to Increase Your Capacity or Number of Services
====================================================

The number of services you can create is limited by the service limits set in your organization. Users with Basic accounts without credit card billing set up are only able to create Free service types. For Basic account users with credit card billing enabled or Enterprise users, your organization is limited in the number of services that can be created. These limits can be changed upon request.
