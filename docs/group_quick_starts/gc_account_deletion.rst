Account Deletion
================================

You can now delete your account without asking help from Solace Cloud support. However, this feature is limited to standard accounts only.

Under the Account tab, click on the Advanced Settings link to view the delete account button as shown below..

After clicking on the Delete Account button, a confirmation dialog will be displayed to provide you with an overview of the components of your Solace Cloud PubSub+ account that will be deleted.
You will then be prompted to enter your password to confirm the deletion.

Once the account is deleted, all of your messaging services will be terminated and you will be logged out of the system. Your outstanding bill will be emailed to you and your credit card would be charged.

If you require further assistance after your account has been deleted, please contact our Support team.
